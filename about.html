<h3>Better health for everyone, everywhere</h3>

<p >
We are building a better, healthier future for people all over the world.
<br>
Working with 194 Member States, across six regions, and from more than 150 offices, WHO staff are united in a shared commitment to achieve better health for everyone, everywhere.
<br>
Together we strive to combat diseases – communicable diseases like influenza and HIV, and noncommunicable diseases like cancer and heart disease.
We help mothers and children survive and thrive so they can look forward to a healthy old age. We ensure the safety of the air people breathe, the food they eat, the water they drink – and the medicines and vaccines they need.

<h3> Who we are</h3>
<hr>
<p >

WHO began when our Constitution came into force on 7 April 1948 – a date we now celebrate every year as World Health Day.
<br>

We are now more than 7000 people working in 150 country offices, in six regional offices and at our headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

<h3>What we do</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Our primary role is to direct and coordinate international health within the United Nations system.
<br>
Our main areas of work are health systems; health through the life-course; noncommunicable and communicable diseases; preparedness, surveillance and response; and corporate services.

<h3>Where we work</h3>

<p>

We support countries as they coordinate the efforts of governments and partners – including bi- and multilaterals, funds and foundations, civil society organizations and the private sector.
<br>
Working together, we attain health objectives by supporting national health policies and strategies.
